Squary--Beginning-of-Paranoia
=============================

The first adventure of Squary the black square -- work in progress
It is compiled with the SDL 2 library, and so I have only tried to on OS X.

The SquaryBeginning file is the compiled binaries on a MacBook Pro running 10.7.5, it will probably not work for you.
I might try to run Windows XP on a virtual machine sometime later next week.
